This work presents the Peixe Babel System, a platform that supports language learning by integrating automatic flashcard generation with AI‑mediated conversational practice. Its primary goal is to reduce the gap between passive lexical knowledge (vocabulary recognition) and active spontaneous production in dialogue. The methodology comprises requirements elicitation, functional and architectural modeling, and the development of a functional prototype that combines a Spaced Repetition System (SRS) for long‑term retention with adaptive conversation sessions tailored to the user's vocabulary and proficiency level. The current prototype is mobile, and the design anticipates expansion to other platforms. In conclusion, the system automates study material creation and provides a safe practice environment, fostering the transition from receptive knowledge to effective communicative use.
